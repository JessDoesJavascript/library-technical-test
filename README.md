Technical test

// ## The Problem

// We want to model the local library. The library has 3 sections - Fiction, Non-Fiction and Magazines.

// The application should allow the user to

// - create a library

// - add the three sections

// - add some simple books to each section.

// Other requirements include:

// - The site must be responsive

// - Books must have an author and a title, so the data entry forms should have some data validation

// - There should be some basic navigation too.
